# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I work on [05/30] #javascript30 challenge (Flex Panel Gallery) , so the streak is going on.
- I also started reading some article about methods to organize CSS, and I got that there isn't an ideal one, but the key is to write less code as possible.
- So I started by reading SMACSS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Tommorow I want to set a GitHub repo to track my progress and going on with #javascript30.
