# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I work on [05/30] #javascript30 challenge (Flex Panel Gallery) , so the streak is going on.
- I also started reading some article about methods to organize CSS, and I got that there isn't an ideal one, but the key is to write less code as possible.
- So I started by reading SMACSS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Tommorow I want to set a GitHub repo to track my progress and going on with #javascript30.

### Day 2: October 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I work on [06/30] #javascript30 challenge (Type Ahead), I got stuck with highlighting feature, but at the end I went out.
- Went ahead with SMACSS tutorial, this pattern design is very focus on DRY priciple (don't repeat yourself), and want to keep css stylesheet categorized into 5 blocks. 
    I plant to follow some of this principles, but as suggested by author, i will try to make some improvements.

**Thoughts:** Tommorow I want to going on with #javascript30.

### Day 3: October 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I ended with [07/30] #javascript30 challenge (Array Cardio Day 2).
- Went deeper with SMACSS Tutorial, I really like the DRY principle, and the separation between structure and style. But, I think that there is too much categorization, that introduce uneeded complexity, CSS must to be easy to code and fast to update.
I am very interested about design patterns, so after this tutorial I will reading another one.
- Worked with CSS Selectors, like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, I already have pretty knowledge about CSS, so I worked only with advanced selectors, that alway can be useful.
I made a stupid [html doc](assets/css-selectors/index.html) to test some selectors, if you want to take a look there is my GitHub page in bio.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30 and SMACSS Tutorial, and maybe I can start to search some plugin on VSC for CSS validation.

### Day 4: October 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I ended with [08/30] #javascript30 challenge (Fun with Canvas).
- I kept reading SMACSS Tutorial, and I found an intersting chapter about depth of applicability. Going too deep with selectors increase dependency on the HTML structure, and obviouslly decrease maintenance efficency.
- I also did some search about CSS validation, and I found that there is an official W3C online tool. But I was search for a Visual Studio Code plugin, so I had download [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass), although validation is not its main purpose, but in order to compile correctly it has to make syntax check. Yeah its meant for SASS, but if you don't know SASS syntax you can simply use classics CSS syntax. However I intend to learn SASS shortly.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30 and hopefully I'll finish SMACSS Tutorial.

### Day 5: October 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [09/30] #javascript30 challenge completed (Dev Tools).
- I going on with SMACSS Tutorial and some intersting thing went out. Class naming is always been a critical threads, everyone has is own idea and style, but follow some keypoints is a mandatory. So I am trying to improve my CSS coding style to keep separate HTML structure from style.
- Besides I found an awesome quote: 'Good programmers like patterns'. A lot of programmers are annoyed by design patterns, or think to they as a secondary thing, but the art of re-use code is an important habit.
- I made some searches about CSS Preprocessors. The main alternatives are: LESS, SASS and Stylus.

**Thoughts:** As always tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, later I must finish SMACSS Tutorial. Finally I have to choice one CSS Preprocessor, so I will compare some of them.

### Day 6: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [10/30] #javascript30, the streak go on (Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes).
- I finally completed SMACSS Tutorial, and the last thing I got from it is the CSS code formatting. Though isn't fit my style, so I made some change. I want to suggest the reading of SMACSS Tutorial to all, because unfortunatly design patterns are often undervalue, even if they are a golden resource.
- Yesterday I was thinking which CSS Preprocessor I should learn, some of you suggest SASS, moreover I saw that is the most used and supported.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, then I start learning SASS and setting up my VSC, later I want to do a summary of what I learn from first week and think about what I should work for the next week.

### Day 7: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [11/30] #javascript30 challenge completed (Custom Video Player).
- I set up Live Sass Compiler to work with SASS, and I tried some different configs.
- I also read some article about SASS, to learn as much as possible before start working with it. I got that SASS extend CSS with some feature like: nested rules, variables (standard CSS also has, but SASS make it more powerful), functions, mixins, and more.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, then I want to try coding some SASS.

### Day 8: October 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [12/30] Today I completed #javascript30 challenge (Key Sequence Detection).
- I read SASS Basics tutorial to get a general idea of what it is, and what is the main features that improve standard CSS. So I made a simple example to test them.
- Briefly I worked with: vars (which are extremely much easier than CSS ones), modules (this feature is very useful to split the code), mixins (are useful especially for vendor prefixes), Inheritance (is a core functionalities of SASS, because it allow the application of DRY principle), Operators (allow to do maths calcs more easiy than calc() in CSS). And last a critical feature, nesting... Nesting is very useful, but often is overused... In CSS the too longer selectors are a bad practice, and nesting can be tempting, so as edge case we can go 3 levels deeper, more is extremely rare case.

**Thoughts:** As every day tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and also with SASS tutorial, I want to reach a good base, in this way I can start some 'useful' practice exercise.

### Day 9: October 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [13/30] Today I completed #javascript30 challenge (Slide in on Scroll).
- I worked with SASS, mainly with selectors. I tried some advanced selectors given by SCSS syntax, and I worked with nesting, so I took care to how deep I was going with nesting, and which is the best way to nest.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and also I want to go deeper with SASS modules and inheritance.

### Day 10: October 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [14/30] Completed another #javascript30 challenge (JS Reference vs Copying)
- I read a lot of tutorials and articles on OOCSS(Object Oriented CSS) desing patterns, and I think it is more actual than SMACSS.
- Last I finally start coding, I tried to apply OOCSS at the best. 

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and I wish to complete the simple layout that I started today.

### Day 11: October 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [15/30] Completed #javascript30 LocalStorage challenge

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and I wish to complete the simple layout that I started today.

### Day 12: October 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [16/30] I completed #javascript30 challenge (Mouse Move Shadow)
- As planned I also finished CSS design, the target wasn't to make a beautiful design but rather try to apply OOCSS design pattern. The main key points of this pattern desing is: avoid descendent selector (like .sidebar > h3), avoid IDs (only in stylesheet), avoid to attaching classes to element selector (like div.header), and try to avoid !important keyword.
Obviously this isn't a maths method that must be applied step by step, but rather a scheme to keep in mind while coding.
Besides it can be easily applied to small projects, bigger projects require more awareness.
A good thing that help me, was to think the DOM elements not for what it have to do, but rather what they represent.
For example a textual logo is still the same either in header or footer, so we can give to it a default styles, and eventually add some customization later.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and maybe start with CSS animations.

### Day 13: October 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [17/30] I completed 17th #javascript30 challenge (Sort Without Articles). Intersting challenge that allow to apply some arrays knoledge.
- I spent a couple hours on CSS Transitions and Animations. And I also realized a small project, some car moving during sunrise and sunset (wooo!).
CSS Transition are very useful for small... transitions. Thanks to cubic-bezier property, they can be more realistics.
Instead CSS Animation are very useful, and with keyframes @-rule, we can make very complex animations.
I plant to go deeper with transitions, though are less powerful than animations, they can be applied widely for small effects, saving a lot of javascript code.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and also work on more 'realistic' CSS transitions.

### Day 14: October 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [18/30] I completed 18th #javascript30 challenge (Adding Up Times with Reduce). Another useful challenge to work with arrays methods.
- Since I completed second week of #100DaysOfCode I had spent a lot of time to summarize what I have reached, so then I adjust my learning path for the incoming week. I got a good knowledge about HTML5 structure, how to separate semantic from style, IDs and Classes naming, and also some basic notion about accessibility. Regarding CSS I have learned about main Design Patterns and Animations, and tried to master them by making some pages. Meantime, also thanks to #javasript30 challenge I could improve my JS skills.
So for the next week I want to read about CSS Flexbox and Grid, and as soon as possible start a small project to put it all together.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and start reading about CSS Flexbox.

### Day 15: October 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [19/30] 19th #javascript30 challenge was completed (Webcam Fun). It was a funny projects. I found useful that inside the tutorial there is a deprecated function (createObjectURL()), so I had the opportunity to do some search and use official doc. I trying to avoid stackoverflow, because 'Copy and Paste' technique is not useful for learning scope.
- I read about Layout, present and past techniques, and some important points came out. Normal flow is the way that elements are displayed without any changes, often is an undervalue stuff, but a webpage must be readable even without styles, because their loading may fail, or maybe there is some user that can't even see a page (screen reader's users). Layouting with Floats is a past method, but we can found it yet in some circumstances. Positioned layout also exist, but may be dangerous because affect document flow. Flex layouts that are one-dimensional layout, often is misunderstood, people try to make two-dimensional layout with flexbox, that isn't what is designed for. Last method is  Grid layout method that is two-dimensional layout, that allow to define a layout like a... grid.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, and start going deeper with Flexbox layout.
