# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I work on [05/30] #javascript30 challenge (Flex Panel Gallery) , so the streak is going on.
- I also started reading some article about methods to organize CSS, and I got that there isn't an ideal one, but the key is to write less code as possible.
- So I started by reading SMACSS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Tommorow I want to set a GitHub repo to track my progress and going on with #javascript30.

### Day 2: October 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I work on [06/30] #javascript30 challenge (Type Ahead), I got stuck with highlighting feature, but at the end I went out.
- Went ahead with SMACSS tutorial, this pattern design is very focus on DRY priciple (don't repeat yourself), and want to keep css stylesheet categorized into 5 blocks. 
    I plant to follow some of this principles, but as suggested by author, i will try to make some improvements.

**Thoughts:** Tommorow I want to going on with #javascript30.

### Day 3: October 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I ended with [07/30] #javascript30 challenge (Array Cardio Day 2).
- Went deeper with SMACSS Tutorial, I really like the DRY principle, and the separation between structure and style. But, I think that there is too much categorization, that introduce uneeded complexity, CSS must to be easy to code and fast to update.
I am very interested about design patterns, so after this tutorial I will reading another one.
- Worked with CSS Selectors, like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, I already have pretty knowledge about CSS, so I worked only with advanced selectors, that alway can be useful.
I made a stupid [html doc](assets/css-selectors/index.html) to test some selectors, if you want to take a look there is my GitHub page in bio.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30 and SMACSS Tutorial, and maybe I can start to search some plugin on VSC for CSS validation.

### Day 4: October 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I ended with [08/30] #javascript30 challenge (Fun with Canvas).
- I kept reading SMACSS Tutorial, and I found an intersting chapter about depth of applicability. Going too deep with selectors increase dependency on the HTML structure, and obviouslly decrease maintenance efficency.
- I also did some search about CSS validation, and I found that there is an official W3C online tool. But I was search for a Visual Studio Code plugin, so I had download [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass), although validation is not its main purpose, but in order to compile correctly it has to make syntax check. Yeah its meant for SASS, but if you don't know SASS syntax you can simply use classics CSS syntax. However I intend to learn SASS shortly.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30 and hopefully I'll finish SMACSS Tutorial.

### Day 5: October 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [09/30] #javascript30 challenge completed (Dev Tools).
- I going on with SMACSS Tutorial and some intersting thing went out. Class naming is always been a critical threads, everyone has is own idea and style, but follow some keypoints is a mandatory. So I am trying to improve my CSS coding style to keep separate HTML structure from style.
- Besides I found an awesome quote: 'Good programmers like patterns'. A lot of programmers are annoyed by design patterns, or think to they as a secondary thing, but the art of re-use code is an important habit.
- I made some searches about CSS Preprocessors. The main alternatives are: LESS, SASS and Stylus.

**Thoughts:** As always tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, later I must finish SMACSS Tutorial. Finally I have to choice one CSS Preprocessor, so I will compare some of them.

### Day 6: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [11/30] #javascript30, the streak go on (Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes).
- I finally completed SMACSS Tutorial, and the last thing I got from it is the CSS code formatting. Though isn't fit my style, so I made some change. I want to suggest the reading of SMACSS Tutorial to all, because unfortunatly design patterns are often undervalue, even if they are a golden resource.
- Yesterday I was thinking which CSS Preprocessor I should learn, some of you suggest SASS, moreover I saw that is the most used and supported.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, then I start learning SASS and setting up my VSC, later I want to do a summary of what I learn from first week and think about what I should work for the next week.

### Day 7: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- [10/30] #javascript30 challenge completed (Custom Video Player).
- I set up Live Sass Compiler to work with SASS, and I tried some different configs.
- I also read some article about SASS, to learn as much as possible before start working with it. I got that SASS extend CSS with some feature like: nested rules, variables (standard CSS also has, but SASS make it more powerful), functions, mixins, and more.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30, then I want to try coding some SASS.
