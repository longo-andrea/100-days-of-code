# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I work on [05/30] #javascript30 challenge (Flex Panel Gallery) , so the streak is going on.
- I also started reading some article about methods to organize CSS, and I got that there isn't an ideal one, but the key is to write less code as possible.
- So I started by reading SMACSS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Tommorow I want to set a GitHub repo to track my progress and going on with #javascript30.

### Day 2: October 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I work on [06/30] #javascript30 challenge (Type Ahead), I got stuck with highlighting feature, but at the end I went out.
- Went ahead with SMACSS tutorial, this pattern design is very focus on DRY priciple (don't repeat yourself), and want to keep css stylesheet categorized into 5 blocks. 
    I plant to follow some of this principles, but as suggested by author, i will try to make some improvements.

**Thoughts:** Tommorow I want to going on with #javascript30.

### Day 3: October 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- I ended with [07/30] #javascript30 challenge (Array Cardio Day 2).
- Went deeper with SMACSS Tutorial, I really like the DRY principle, and the separation between structure and style. But, I think that there is too much categorization, that introduce uneeded complexity, CSS must to be easy to code and fast to update.
I am very interested about design patterns, so after this tutorial I will reading another one.
- Worked with CSS Selectors, like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, I already have pretty knowledge about CSS, so I worked only with advanced selectors, that alway can be useful.
I made a stupid [html doc](assets/css-selectors/index.html) to test some selectors, if you want to take a look there is my GitHub page in bio.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will going on with #javascript30 and SMACSS Tutorial, and maybe I can start to search some plugin on VSC for CSS validation.
